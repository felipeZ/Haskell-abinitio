Haskell-abinitio
================

This package can calculate the Hartree Fock energy
of a given molecule geometry and a basis set solving the
Roothaan Hall equations through a self consistent field
procedure. It uses the Harris Functional as an initial
density guess and the DIIS method to greatly improve
the convergence.
The entire code is written using the [Repa](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/repa)
library and focusing our efforts on efficiency, parallelism and code readability.
Using Haskellâ€™s higher order abstraction we are
trying to develop an EDSL appropriate for quantum
mechanics problems, creating code operators able to
fairly mimic the physical ones.
